									<h1>About<br />
									</h1>
									<p>I am currently pursuing Masters in Philosophy with a specialisation in Planning & Development from Indian Insititute of Technology Bombay. To know more about me, keep scrollling :) <br />

								<p>My academic training and experience consist of interdisciplinary studies. When I graduated from the University of Delhi, I realized how interesting I find research in social sciences. I pursued my masters from the Department of Political Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, where I was awarded the best academic performance scholarship. A masters in Public Administration gave me specialized knowledge in public policy, but it did not satisfy the constant learner in me. I was curious to know so much more. So, I set out on a journey to answer the question “What knowledge should I gain, produce, and dedicate most of my life to?”  The map to the answer of this question ushered me to an interdisciplinary program of Masters in Philosophy at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. 
								</p>
								<p>My experience and learning in different universities have taught me that there’s an enormous amount of knowledge that is waiting to be procured, and it takes patience and perseverance to absorb and produce a genuine understanding of it. By exploring different subjects, I found myself to be passionate about environmental psychology, and my research studies followed its direction. I have completed projects as well as seminars for the same. I am trained in qualitative as well as quantitative data analysis. Broadly my research interests are Human Behaviour; Climate Change; Psychology of Development and Sustainability; and Impacts of Extreme Events on Cognition.</p>
							<p>I have been actively participating in conferences and seminars throughout my studies. During my undergraduate, I got the opportunity to be part of the BRICS & SCO Youth Forum, held at Ufa City, Russia. </p>
								<p> Apart from academics and research, I sneak out time to play chess, snooker and practice to be better in lawn-tennis and basketball as well. And when in soothing mood, I like to play guitar and keyboards, also paint every so often. :) </p>
